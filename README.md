An AI built in Rust for the game of Copenhagen Hnefatafl. I built this as my thesis work for my bachelor's degree in computer science at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, and received the highest possible mark for it.

The project is a web application, the backend written in Rust. It communicates with a React frontend used to play the game itself.
